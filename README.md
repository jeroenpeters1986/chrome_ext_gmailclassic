# Gmail classic layout reverter for Chrome

This Chrome extension brings back the compactness of the older Gmail style from before October 2018. I really like my inbox to be compact and my read/unread to have a good contrast.

## What does it do?
This extension injects only CSS on the pages that start with `https://mail.google.com/`.

CSS is what styles a webpage. The CSS rules alter the new Gmail layout in a way that it looks like the old layout in the inbox. The buttons, which had icons before, will still be text and the new header will also be in place. 

The functionality of Gmail will _not_ change by using this extension.

## So, what does it look like?
After installing this extension, your Gmail will look like this:
